This is a test set of ngram count data with a few tablet files.

The data itself is ngrams1.txt, which is a sorted file of ngram
counts. There is one ngram per line, and it's formatted like this:

    ngram1 <space> count
    ngram2 <space> count

Note that the ngrams contain tab characters, so splitting on
whitespace is not advised. The safest thing to do will be splitting on
the last space character on the line.

The other files in this set are a series of tablets, with the ngrams
and counts as key-value data:

    ngram1 -> count
    ngram2 -> count

The counts are stored as text, same as they are in the original file.

ngrams1-1block-uncompressed.tab: one key-value block, uncompressed
ngrams1-1block-compressed.tab: one key-value block, Snappy compressed
ngrams1-Nblock-compressed.tab: several key-value blocks, Snappy compressed

They all contain the same data as ngrams1.txt in the same order.
