This is a test set of ngram count data with a two tablet files.

The data itself is ngrams2.txt, which is a sorted file of ngram
counts. There is one ngram per line, and it's formatted like this:

    ngram1 <space> count
    ngram2 <space> count

Note that the ngrams contain tab characters, so splitting on
whitespace is not advised. The safest thing to do will be splitting on
the last space character on the line.

The other files in this set are a series of tablets, with the ngrams
and counts as key-value data:

    ngram1 -> count
    ngram2 -> count

The counts are stored as text, same as they are in the original file.

The tablets are designed to be read in a stack, with values in tab0
being overridden by tab1.

i.e.:

    ds := NewDatastore()
    ds.PushTablet(tab0)
    ds.PushTablet(tab1)
